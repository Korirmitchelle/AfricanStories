    <h1 >ANANSI GOES FISHING</h1>
    <h4><em> A Tale from West Africa</em></h4>
<P>Foolish Anansi thought he could trick a
fisherman into doing his work for him.<br>
"Let's go fishing," he suggested.<br>
"Very well," said the fisherman, who was
clever and quite wise to Anansi's tricks.<br>
"I'll make the nets and you can get tired for
me."<br>
"Wait," said Anansi, "I'll make the nets and
you can get tired for me!" Anansi made
nets as his friend pretended to be tired.<br>
They caught four fish.<br>
The fisherman said, "Anansi, you take
these. I'll take tomorrow's catch. It might
be bigger."<br>
Greedily imagining the next day's catch,
Anansi said, "No, you take these and I'll
take tomorrow's fish."</P>
<p>But the next day, the nets were rotting
away and no fish were caught. The
fisherman said, "Anansi, take these rotten
nets to market. You can sell them for much
money."<br>
When Anansi shouted, "Rotten nets for
sale!" in the marketplace, people beat him
with sticks.<br>
"Some partner you are," Anansi said to the
fisherman as he rubbed his bruises. "I took
the beatings. At least you could have taken
the pain."<br>
Anansi never tried to trick the fisherman
again!</p>
