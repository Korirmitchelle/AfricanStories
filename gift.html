<h1 >THE GIFT OF A COW TAIL SWITCH</h1>
<P><em>A West African Tale</em></P>

<P>A great warrior did not return from the
hunt. His family gave him up for dead, all
except his youngest child who each day
would ask, "Where is my father? Where is
my father?"<BR>
The child's older brothers, who were
magicians, finally went forth to find him.
They came upon his broken spear and a
pile of bones. The first son assembled the
bones into a skeleton; the second son put
flesh upon the bones; the third son
breathed life into the flesh.<BR>
The warrior arose and walked into the
village where there was great celebration.<BR>
He said, "I will give a fine gift to the one
who has brought me back to life."<BR>
Each one of his sons cried out, "Give it to
me, for I have done the most."<BR>
"I will give the gift to my youngest child,"
said the warrior. "For it is this child who
saved my life. A man is never truly dead
    until he is forgotten!"<br>
