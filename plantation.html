<h1 >IN THE PLANTATION</h1>
<P><em>By  Oyet Sisto Ocen</em></P>


<p>I still recall its sweetness when he gave it to us. Uncle Tom found us playing in the banana 
plantations. We were searching for  nsenene,  the grasshopper which appeared seasonally when it 
rained in our village. We searched for them on the ground and in the  folds of the banana  leaves. 
The  first time we tasted it was when  aunt brought it  back  from Kampala,  "Nakato and Kato come 
and get some sweets," she'd cried. We were plucking the legs and wings off nsenene in the backyard 
of our grass-thatched hut. The sweets were different colours. I unwrapped the white  vuvera, 
polythene paper, from one and threw it in my mouth. I felt the  sticky honey sweetness  fill  my 
mouth and I swallowed. </p>
<p>We ran past Joe's house to  reach Katumba's house so that he could taste the  nsenene. Kato was 
panting. We wanted to tell Katumba the news quickly and run back home. Mummy didn't want us 
playing with Katumba. She said he had bad manners; he liked playing with his male part in front o f 
us.<br> 
"Katumba, our aunt came from Kampala," Kato told him, from the cool shade where he was 
seated. He was plucking the wings and the legs of nsenene. The wind was blowing the bananas leaves 
lightly, swaying them from side to side. "She brought for us  some sweet." Katumba dropped the 
saucepan he was holding. Kato broke the sweet, which looked like a small stone, into two halves 
with his teeth and gave one to Katumba, "Eat." <br>
They had been good friends in spite of mummy's restriction. Katumba threw his  half into his 
mouth. Then he opened his mouth, his lips moulded, formed to look like a hallway. He was missing 
two lower teeth which left a path for us to see his tongue rotating. It made us laugh.<br>
"It's sweet, like ripe banana," said Katumba laughing.<br>
"Yes, Aunt Janet said it makes children's teeth grow," said Kato.<br>
When Katumba heard this he started rubbing a small remnant of the sweet on his pink gums which
made us laugh more. We ran through  the long trail of the banana  plantation which connected  our 
home with that of Katumba's. It was  owned by  Mr.  Mukasa the old man. He planted oranges and 
pawpaw trees at the side of his plantation. We always stole from his trees when  we emptied our 
fruit trees. Mummy didn't encourage stealing so we only did it when she was away. </p>
<p>When we reached home, we found aunt was telling mummy about the city. She told mummy that 
Uncle Tom's business had made him one  of the richest  men in the city. He had so much money he 
could buy the whole village and its contents. </p>
<p>That morning aunt brought out the metal she brought from the city. It was for piercing ears. Aunt 
insisted  for our  ears  to be pierced so that  we did not fall prey to child sacrifices.  But daddy was 
against  the  piercing of the boys' ears, he said  it made them look like rouges. So aunt and mummy 
pierced my ears and not Kato's. It was painful, but aunt said when it heals, I would put on glittering 
earrings which would dangle to my shoulders which would make me look beautiful.</p>
<p>When Katumba and Joe came home, we sneaked into  Mr.  Mukasa's plantation to steal some 
pawpaw. After getting the pawpaw, we ran  to our backyard, where no one would see us.  The 
plantation was situated by the road which ran  from our village to  the  school we  attended  -  it was 
the same  road  that  aunt used to come from Kampala. In our playground,  we would sit for hours 
competing with each other to see who could throw stones the furthest. Sometimes we would fight 
over  something smal We would then reconvene in  the same place. In the playground we would 
dream  of becoming somebody  big in future.  Kato dreamt of becoming president, Joe dreamt of 
becoming a driver, Katumba, the  head teacher of our school. I too, dreamt of teaching in our 
school, I wanted to be a class mistress and wear  transparent  spectacles  like Miss John our class 
teacher.</p>
<p>Uncle Tom came down that road. He waved, beckoning us to come over. We ran in his direction. 
We were already imagining what he might give us. When we reached his car, he pulled the sweets 
from the black  vuvera  and gave it to us. We were very happy and we began eating the sweets 
immediately. He drove off and we ran after his car. He lowered his panel and gave something to the 
men who were playing cards  in  the shade. He left them cheering,  'mukulu, mukulu, big man, big 
man.'  We kept on running after him until he disappeared down the village where we couldn't see 
him. We stood there watching the dust raised by his car. Katumba said the smell produced by the 
car was very nice and he felt like eating it with bread.</p>
<p>When we were coming back from school the next day, we followed the marks left by Uncle 
Tom's car tyres. Katumba and I were on the right side, while Joe was on the left. Kato didn't come 
to school that day, he was not feeling well. Mummy decided to leave him at home a nd went to tend 
the garden. We missed his company on our way back. But we kept on playing as usual. Reaching 
our backyard, Katumba saw something red mixed in with the sand.<p>
<p>"It's blood," he said.<br>
"No, that is Mr. Mukasa's pawpaw," said Joe and we laughed.<br>
"My mum has cooked chicken today," I said. <br></p>
<p>In that same spot, our lovely playing ground, whenever mummy wanted to prepare chick en soup, 
she slaughtered the chicken there. She was skilled at it. She stepped on the chicken's wings with her 
feet  then  on the legs of the chicken with the other, holding the knife with her right hand and the 
head of the chicken with  her  left. She sliced the neck of the chicken with one stroke. Then she let 
the chicken  fly headless and  it  flapped  about repeatedly,  blood jetting from its neck. Kato and I 
would stand there watching the chicken struggle until it stopped and mummy would submerge it in 
hot water and pluck its feathers. </p>
<p>When we returned to the compound we found people had gathered. Every space in the compound
was occupied. Men sat in silence with their heads bent. Most women were inside ,  tears flowed 
from their eyes. One voice came from inside the house. It was a familiar voice to m e. I squeezed 
through the bodies  and rushed to the door, I wanted to see mummy and ask her why people were 
everywhere in our compound. But the doorway was congested; I could not access the house. Aunt 
came and carried me from the door and went with me to the edge  of the compound, she was 
crying. I put my fingers into my mouth and could not ask her what had happened. I imagined 
mummy and daddy were no more and decided  I would find Uncle Tom and  beg him to take Kato 
and me with him to the city, for I could not stay without mummy and daddy in this village.  In the 
distance I saw Mr. Mukasa coming to join the crowd. His face looked like he was either laughing or 
crying, I couldn't tell which. He was stooped over with one hand on his waist, while the other held 
his walking stick. It was the posture Kato liked imitating when we played.
"It is Kato," aunt said amidst tears. I looked into her eyes to make her tell me what had  happened 
to Kato, but she bent down her head and I felt warm tears on my arms.<br>
"Where is Kato?" I asked aunt.<br>
"His head has gone."<br></p>
<p>The head,  I spoke to myself.  What has happen to his head? And why should he accept his head to go and 
leave him. What is aunt saying now, she should be clear. "Kato's head has gone". What does this mean?
Then I heard aunt whispering amidst the crying; "I wished your father had agreed." She sobbed. 
My eyes were filled with tears, but I didn't know  why I was crying. Perhaps I was crying because 
aunt was crying? What she told me shouldn't have  made me cry. If Kato's head had  gone, it would 
come back. It would find Kato and fix itself, we would still run in that long trail of the ban ana 
plantations, we would  meet Joe and Katumba, probably we would  still  plan to go and steal the 
pawpaw from Mr. Mukasa's plantation and eat in our backyard.<br>
When I opened my eyes, tears fell down. I saw that Joe and Katumba were still standing along the 
road near our compound; they had not gone home since we came from school. Aunt continued 
crying.<br>
"I knew your dad was wrong, he should have allowed the piercing."<br>
She explained that when she was in Kampala; she saw many posters  warning parents to protect 
their children from  the  witches who hunt children for  sacrifices. The witches believed  when a 
human is sacrificed, a big sum  of money would be acquired to boost their business. I became
confused with what aunt was talking about, that's when she finally told me  -  Kato had been killed. 
My brain shut down after hearing that. I was seeing everybody as a distant  mist. I tried  to slide 
down from aunt, I wanted to roll down and cry, but she held me tight.</p>
<p>For two days, mummy and I didn't say a word to each other. I wanted to say something  to break 
the silence which had descended on us like unexpected rains.  I wanted to tell her  that Uncle Tom 
had been giving us sweets whenever he came from Kampala, but I didn't know how to say it.  I 
wanted to  confess to her about the time  we followed the marks from  Uncle Tom's car tyres  when 
we were coming from school.  However, no matter my desire to speak to her, I couldn't break the 
silence between us.<br>
When I looked  at her, I thought of the way she  had slaughtered the chicken over Christmas. How 
when she had cut its neck, it still flew high in the air. How Kato and I laughed at it while  blood was 
jetting from its severed  neck. I was almost laughing at that image again. But when I  thought that 
that same knife may have been used to slice through Kato's neck, something came like strange wind 
and blocked  my throat. I was breathless. Invisible hands were squeezing my throat so that tears 
could flow from my eyes and roll onto my cheeks. When I cried, mummy screamed like she was 
mad.</p>
<p>One day Joe and Katumba came to see me. Since Kato's head went, I hadn't  played with them. I 
stayed with mummy most of the time watching her flowing tears as she cried silently. Only when 
aunt was around would she talk in a low voice.<br>
"Daddy said it was Uncle Tom who did it," said Joe.<br>
"I don't know," I said.<br>
"He might have given Kato some sweet for buying his head," said Katumba.<br> 
"Dad said police got him several times doing the same thing, but always he gets away . He told me 
not to respond when a stranger calls me."<br>
"But Uncle Tom is not a stranger."<br>
"He is. He does not live in this village anymore, he only comes to hunt for small penis es like yours 
to be taken to the witch."<br>
"That is why he is rich?"<br>
"Yes, he deals in children's head and penises."<br>
I thought about what the two boys said. God knows what they were talking about. I was seated 
listening to them. I pictured mummy's face since the death of  Kato, how she would bend over a 
bunch of matoke for hours before she could pick one and peel.<br>
"What if he gives us sweets again like last time, should we take them?"<br>
"Ha, you joke, your big head with the missing teeth will go and make money for somebod y. Even 
that penis you always play with, perhaps with all the testicles." Katumba laughed. <br>
<p>Their  words were unbearable. At the age of six,  Katumba  did not know when he was being 
insensitive.  His  words drove me away I couldn't stay with them anymore.  I went to  the plantation 
and sat near a cluster of banana trees, where we had all played since we were  three with Kato. We 
had imagined why bananas gave birth from their roots, why it does not germinate and why the tree 
is cut down once it bears fruit. I sat there wondering whether   I would see Kato again, if the money 
his head would make would come to mummy as well.  Hearing Katumba and Joe faintly, I started 
singing a song, which I have never known before. And the song didn't come to my tongue in sound; 
it remained in my heart, song of  a missing  beloved brother! When I came back, I found the two 
boys were still talking.<br>
"Nakato, don't cry, dad will bring some sweets today. I will give you some."<br>
"I no longer eat sweet Joe," I said.<br>
"Uncle Tom will be caught and killed," said Katumba.<br>
"I don't care, that will not bring back Kato."<br>
<p>The two boys remained silent. The wind stopped blowing the banana leaves. My heart was a 
public drum, beating loudly with longing. One  nsenene  leapt up before it went down again. I 
remembered that day Katumba was plucking off the head of  nsenenes  with ease before putting them 
in the saucepan. Could Kato have turned into  nsenene  in Uncle Tom's hands and then  his head 
plucked off  with ease or he could have changed  into that chicken that we enjoyed on Christmas
Day? In this plantation, do children sometimes change into chicken or nsenene? <br>
"But why don't they stop him?" asked Joe.<br>
I heard Katumba laughing before he said, "They will stop him one day if they get him."<br>
"When is that one day, tomorrow?" I asked.<br>
"I don't know, but one day."<br>
My worry was mummy, she could cry the whole day. Daddy travelled to the city almost every day 
and I didn't know why he was going so  often. Could he still be looking for Kato? I didn't know. I 
wish dad could bring Kato back. I wish the lobe of earth that I threw without looking into the  pit
could bring back his head and bind it back to his neck. If dad's frequent going to the city was with 
the hope of finding him again, that would be good news for me, even Joe and Katumba would 
celebrate with me. But when dad spoke faintly to mummy in low voice, my hope vanished. When I 
heard a sob in mummy's voice, I cried. When I heard dad telling mummy that Uncle Tom was 
caught with a sack and blood in his car and that was not enough evidence, I didn't know what to 
think. I coiled there on  my lonely bed. The space  left by Kato's death was very big, we had been 
together in the womb as twins - this new space was unbearable. 
Mummy told daddy to leave everything. But dad insisted he would still go back. He would pay the 
money which the policemen said would act like a stone  -  anchoring Kato's file so that it is  not
'blown by the wind'  as they investigated the case. He would give the money for bringing Uncle 
Tom back to the prison,  since  the time  he was captured,  he left to urinate and  didn't come back. 
He would want to see the witch doctor who confessed that he dealt with Uncle Tom,  but was 
rubbished by the police as being insane.</p> 
<p>I wanted to open my eyes and  see, but the night was so dark. It was blinding. The night was long. 
I could hear the conversation of Katumba and Joe coming to my ears faintly. They kept me awake 
in bed. When morning approached, mummy's face was heavy. I had to look for the company of 
Katumba and Joe. Much as their words made me uncomfortable, at least they gave  me  company. 
Although Joe was only two years older than Katumba, he spoke much more maturely.
When I was with Joe and Katumba, I forgot my problems a bit. Katumba advised us to go and get 
some pawpaw from Mr. Mukasa's plantation. We sneaked  in. Mr. Mukasa was busy inside his  hut; 
he only greeted us with the white smoke on top of his hut.  Katumba picked one ripe pawpaw. We 

moved farther into  the middle of the plantation where the banana leaves wouldn't give way to
sunlight. It was very dark, but we loved it. We were getting accustomed to darkness in our village. 
When we cleared ground, we uncovered the banana leaves which were softened by moisture and 
covering the place. We sat down,  Katumba cut the pawpaw. We ate while giggling. Joe stood up, 
we  saw his leg going down into  the earth, he pulled it out and he told us to run. Though I didn't 
know why, I started running after him because I always believed  in Joe. Katumba remained, 
laughing at us.<br>
"Why are you running?" he said.<br>
I stopped and looked at him. "Come we go, let's  leave this place, it's so dark." Joe didn't talk, he 
was just running ahead. I saw Katumba kneeling down near the place where Joe's leg had sunk. 
"There might be ripe bananas inside."<br>
<p>He started scooping the soil with his  hands  and  throwing it behind  him. I went back and stood 
near  him watching. Joe stood the furthest  away  from us. Katumba continued until he saw a sack, 
that confirmed his thinking. Mr. Mukasa had buried bananas there. When he scrubbed all the soil 
from the  sack, he removed it at once, expecting to see the yellow bananas. He jumped abruptly to 
his feet. Looking at me, I saw his eyes open wide, his eyeballs dilating. </p>
<p>Joe came near me. We moved toward Katumba together to see what he was seeing. Without a 
word, we began running. We ran, when we stopped somewhere to catch some breath, Katumba 
said, "His head is alive."<br>
"I...I don't know," said Joe.<br>
"It is true Joe; he was looking at me when I removed the sack."<br>
"Go...go and...and  you call, let him out and we'll go home." <br>He started running again. Katumba 
followed Joe and me. It  was horrible, more than anything  I have ever seen. I didn't expect to see 
Kato's head. Truly Kato was alive. His eyes were open.  He was seeing,  I whispered.  He was clearly 
seeing, only that he can't talk. His voice cannot be heard, now.   Kato was seeing, but his voice.  I kept on 
saying things  which I didn't know  to myself as we ran toward Mr.  Mukasa's hut; we needed 
somebody to help us.</p>
<p>The last thing we saw was the big silver cross which fell from the sack. <br>
"That cross he is putting on, we can also put on," huffed Joe as we were running.<br>
"Yes, we can all put on." I said, not knowing exactly what I was saying.<br>
"I hope he cried, before he was killed," said Joe.<br>
"Maybe."<br>
"If someone had heard they could have helped him."<br>
"Kato's voice was small, no one could hear. And this place is very dark, we are in the plantation, 
no one will ever see this."<br>
Katumba was running very fast ahead of us, we saw him entering inside Mr. Mukasa's house. We 
rushed after him; when we reached the door he was coming out of the room. He told us he had 
seen blood in the bottle in Mr. Mukasa's house. Before we could ask him, he sta rted running again. 
We followed him before I branched and ran straight home. </p>
<p>When I reached home, dad was sitting at the door. I didn't know what I told him. But I heard him 
saying, "I will go and pick it." I didn't know which one he meant, the head or  the bottle. I couldn't 
imagine dad holding Kato's head.<br>
I rolled in my bed and closed my eyes tight so I would not see Kato's head in my mind. When I 
imagined Mr.  Mukasa and Uncle Tom squeezing blood from Kato's head, I bit the blanket. I 
wanted to climb on top of the hut and throw myself down. I lay on the bed waiting to see what dad 
would bring. And I kept on whispering, Dad will fix back Kato's head and we shall be together again.</p>
