<h1 >SACRIFICIAL LAMB</h1>
<P><em>By  Chinua Achebe</em></P>




<p>JULIUS Obi sat gazing at his
typewriter. The fat chief clerk, his
boss, was snoring at his table.
Outside, the gatekeeper in his green
uniform was sleeping at his post. No
customer had passed through the
gate for nearly a week. There was
an empty basket on the giant
weighing machine. A few palm
kernels lay in the dust around the
machine.<br>
Julius went to the window that
overlooked the great market on the
bank of the Niger. This market, like
all Ibo markets, had been held on
one of the four days of the week.
But with the coming of the white
man and the growth of Umuru into
a big palm-oil port, it had become a
daily market. In spite of that
however, it was still busiest on its
original Nkwo day, because the deity
that presided over it cast her spell
only on that day. It was said that
she appeared in the form of an old
woman in the center of the market
just before cockcrow and waved her
magic fan in the four directions of
the earth -- in front of her, behind
her, to the right, and to the left -- to
draw to the market men and
women from distant clans. And they
came, these men and women,
bringing the produce of their lands:
palm oil and kernels, kola nuts,
cassava, mats, baskets, and
earthenware pots. And they took
home many-colored cloths, smoked
fish, iron pots and plates.<br>
Others came by the great river
bringing yams and fish in their
canoes. Sometimes it was a big
canoe with a dozen or more people
in it; sometimes it was just a
fisherman and his wife in a small
vessel from the swiftflowing
Anambara. They moored their
canoe on the bank and sold their
fish, after much haggling. The
woman then walked up the steep
banks of the river to the heart of the
market to buy salt and oil and, if the
sales had been good, a length of
cloth. And for her children at home
she bought bean cakes or akara and
mai-mai, which the Igara women
cooked. As evening approached,
they took up their paddles and
paddled away, the water
shimmering in the sunset and their
canoe becoming smaller and smaller
in the distance until it was just a
dark crescent on the water's face
and two dark bodies swaying
forwards and backwards in it.
Julius Obi was not a native of
Umuru. He came from a bush village
twenty or so miles away. But having
passed his Standard Six in a mission
school in 1920 he came to Umuru to
work as a clerk in the offices of the
Niger Company, which dealt in palm
oil and kernels. The offices were
situated beside the famous Umuru
market, so that in his first two or
three weeks Julius had to learn to
work against the background of its
noise. Sometimes when the chief
clerk was away or asleep he walked
to the window and looked down on
the vast anthill activity. Most of
these people were not there
yesterday, he thought, and yet the
market was as full. There must be
many, many people in the world. Of
course they say that not everyone
who came to the great market was a
real person. Janet's mother had said
so.</p>
<p>"Some of the beautiful young
women you see squeezing through
the crowds are not real people but
mammy-wota from the river," she
said.<br>
"How does one know them?" asked
Julius, whose education placed him
above such superstitious stuff. But
he took care not to sound
unbelieving. He had long learned
that it was bad policy to argue with
Ma on such points.<br>
"You can always tell," she explained,
"because they are beautiful with a
beauty that is not of this world. You
catch a glimpse of them with the tail
of your eye, then they disappear in
the crowd."
<p>Julius thought about these things as
he now stood at the window looking
down at the empty market. Who
would have believed that the great
market could ever be so empty? But
such was the power of Kitikpa, or
smallpox.
When Umuru had been a little
village, it had been swept and kept
clean by its handful of inhabitants.
But now it had grown into a busy,
sprawling, crowded, and dirty river
port. And Kitikpa came. No other
disease is feared by the lbo people as
much as they fear Kitikpa. It is
personified as an evil deity. Its
victims are not mourned lest it be
offended. It put an end to the
coming and going between
neighbors and between villages.<br>
They said, " Kitikpa is in that village,
and immediately it was cut off by its
neighbors.<br>
Julius was worried because it was
almost a week since he had seen
Janet, the girl he was going to
marry. Ma had explained to him
very gently that he should no longer
come to see them "until this thing is
over by the power of Jehovah." Ma
was a very devout Christian, and
one reason why she approved of
Julius for her only daughter was
that he sang in the church choir.
<br>"You must keep to your rooms," she
had said. "You never know whom
you might meet on the streets. That
family has got it." She pointed at the
house across the road. "That is what
the yellow palm frond at the
doorway means. The family were
all moved away today in the big
government lorry."
Janet walked a short way with him,
and they said good night. And they
shook hands, which was very odd.
Julius did not go straight home. He
went to the bank of the river and
just walked up and down it. He must
have been there a long time, because
he was still there when the ekwe, or
wooden gong, of the night spirit
sounded. He immediately set out for
home, half walking and half
running. He had about half an hour
to get home before the spirit ran its
race through the town.</p>
<p>As Julius hurried home he stepped
on something that broke with a
slight liquid explosion. He stopped
and peeped down at the footpath.
The moon was not yet up, but there
was some faint light which showed
that it would not be long delayed. In
this light Julius saw that he had
stepped on a sacrificial egg. There
were young palm fronds around it.
Someone oppressed by misfortune
had brought the offering to the
crossroads in the dusk. And he had
stepped on it and taken the
sufferer's ill luck to himself.
"Nonsense," he said and hurried
away. But it was too late; the night
spirit was already abroad. Its voice
rose high and clear in the still, black
air. It was a long way away, but
Julius knew that distance did not
apply to these beings. So he made
straight for the cocoyam farm beside
the road and threw himself on his
belly. He had hardly done this when
he heard the rattling staff of the
spirit and a thundering stream of
esoteric speech. He shook all over.
The sounds came bearing down on
him. And then he could hear the
footsteps. It was as if twenty men
were running together. In no time at
all the sounds had passed and
disappeared in the distance on the
other side of the road.</p>
<p>As Julius stood at the window
looking out on the empty market he
lived through that night again. It
was only a week ago, but already it
seemed to be separated from the
present by a vast emptiness. This
emptiness deepened with the
passage of time. On this side stood
Julius, and on the other Ma and
Janet, who were carried away by
the smallpox.</p>
