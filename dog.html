<h1 >THE WISE DOG</h1>

<P>One day nine dogs went out to hunt. They
met a lion. He said "I am hunting too. I am
very, very hungry. Let us hunt together."
So the dogs and the lion hunted together
all day.<BR>
They caught ten antelopes.
Then the lion said" Now we must divide
    this meat."</BR>
One of the dogs said "Why, that's easy. We
are ten, and we have ten antelopes. So,
    each of us will have one antelope."
<p>The lion became very angry. He hit the
poor dog and blinded him. The other dogs
did not say a word. But then one of the
dogs said, "Our brother was wrong. We
must give nine antelopes to King Lion.
Then they will be ten together. And we
dogs shall take one antelope and we shall
also be ten together."</p>
<p>The lion liked his answer and asked the
dog "Who taught you to divide like this?
You are a wise dog."</p>

The dog answered "Oh, King Lion, you hit
our brother and blinded him. That blind
brother taught me, King Lion!"
