<h1 >UPRIGHT REVOLUTION</h1>
<P><em>By  Ngugi wa Thiong'o</em></P>



<p>A long time ago humans used to walk on legs and arms, just like all the other
four limbed creatures. Humans were faster than hare, leopard or rhino. Legs and arms were closer than any
other organs: they had similar corresponding joints: shoulders and
hips; elbows and knees; ankles and wrists; feet and hands, each ending
with five toes and fingers, with nails on each toe and finger. Hands and feet
had similar arrangements of their five toes and finger from the big toe and
thumb to the smallest toes and pinkies.
In those days the thumb was close to the other fingers, the same as the big
toe. Legs and arms called each other first cousins. They helped each other carry the body
wherever it wanted to go; the market, the shops, up and down trees and
mountains, anywhere that called for movement. Even in the water, they worked well together to help the body
float, swim or dive. They were democratic and egalitarian in their relationship. They could also borrow
the uses of the product of other organs, say sound from mouth, hearing from the ear, smell from the
nose, and even sight from the eyes. Their rhythm and seamless coordination made the other parts
green with envy. They resented having to lend their special genius to the cousins. Jealousy blinded them to the
fact that legs and hands took them places. They started plotting against the two pairs.</p>

<p>Tongue borrowed a plan from Brain
and put it to action immediately. It
begun to wonder, loudly, about the
relative powers of arms and legs. Who
was stronger, it wondered. The two
cousin limbs, who had never been
bothered by what the other had and
could do, now borrowed sound from
mouth and begun to claim they were
more important to the body than the
other. This quickly changed into who
was more elegant; arms bragged about
the long slim fingers of its hands, at
the same time making derisive
comments about toes being short and
thick. Not to be outdone, toes
countered and talked derisively about
thin fingers, starving cousins! This
went on for days, at times affecting
their ability to work together
effectively. It finally boiled down to
the question of power; they turned to
other organs for arbitration.
It was Tongue who suggested a contest.
A brilliant idea, all agreed. But what?
Some suggested a wrestling match - leg
and arm wrestling. Others came up
with sword play, juggling, racing, or
playing a game like chess or checkers
but each was ruled out as hard to
bring about or unfair to one or the
other limb. It was Tongue once gain,
after borrowing thought from Brain,
who came with simple solution. Each
set of organs would come up with a
challenge, in turns. Arms and legs
agreed.</p>
<p>The contest took place in a clearing in
the forest, near a river. All organs
were on maximum alert for danger or
anything that might catch the body by
surprise, now that its organs were
engaged in internal struggle. Eyes
scanned far and wide for the tiniest of
dangers from whatever distance; ears
primed themselves to hear the slightest
sound from whatever distance; nose
cleared its nostrils the better to detect
scent of any danger that escaped the
watchful eyes and the listening ears;
and the tongue was ready to shout and
scream, danger.</p>
<p>Wind spread news of the contest to the
four corners of the forest, water and
air. Four legged animals were among
the first to gather, many of the big
ones holding green branches to show
they came in peace. It was a colorful
crowd of Leopard, Cheetah, Lion,
Rhino, Hyena, Elephant, Giraffe,
Camel, long horned Cow and short-
horned Buffalo, Antelope, Gazelle,
Hare, Mole and Rat. Water-Dwellers,
Hippo, Fish, Crocodile, spread their
upper part on the banks, leaving the
rest in the river. The two leggeds,
Ostrich, Guinea-fowl, and Peacock
flapped their wings in excitement;
birds chirped from the trees; Cricket
sang all the time. Spider, Worm,
Centipede, Millipede crawled on the
ground or trees. Chameleon walked
stealthily, carefully, taking its time
while Lizard ran about, never settling
down on one spot. Monkey,
Chimpanzee, Gorilla, jumped from
branch to branch. Even the trees and
the bush, swayed gently from side to
side, bowed, and then stood still in
turns.</p>
<p>Mouth opened the contest with a song:
<br><em>We do this to be happy
<br>We do this to be happy
<br>We do this to be happy
<br>Because we all
<br>Come from one nature.</em></p>
<p>Arm and Legs swore to accept the
outcome gracefully; no tantrums,
threats of boycott, strikes or go-slow.
Arms issued the first challenge: they
threw a piece of wood on the ground.
The leg, left or right, or in
combination, was to pick up the piece
of wood from the ground and throw it.
The two legs could consult each other,
at any time in the contest, and deploy
their toes, individually or collectively,
in any order to effect their mission.
They tried to turn it over; push it; they
tried all sorts of combinations but they
could not pick it up properly: and as
for moving it, the best they could do
was kick it a few inches away. Seeing
this, Fingers borrowed sounds from
the mouth and laughed, and laughed.
Arms, the challenger, paraded
themselves, as in beauty contest,
showing off their slim looks, and then
in different combinations picked the
piece of wood. They threw it far into
the forest, eliciting a collective sigh of
admiration from the contestants and
spectators. They displayed other skills:
they picked tiny pieces of sand from a
bowl of rice; they threaded needles;
they made little small pulleys for
moving heavier wood; made some
spears and threw them quite far,
moves and acts that the toes could only
dream about. Legs could only sit there
and marvel at the display of dexterity
and flexibility of their slim cousins.
Arms of the spectators clapped
thunder in admiration and solidarity
with fellow arms, which upset the legs
a great deal. But they were not about
to concede: even as they sat there
looking alittle bit glum, their big toes
drooling little circles on the sand, they
were trying to figure out a winning
challenge.</p>
<p>At last, it was the turn of legs and toes
to issue a challenge. Theirs, they said,
was simple. Hands should carry the
whole body from one part of the circle
to the other. What a stupid challenge,
thought the arrogant fingers. It was a
sight to see. Everything about the body
was upside down. Hands touched the
ground; eyes were close to the ground,
their angles of vision severely
restricted by their proximity to the
ground; dust entered the nose, causing
it to sneeze; legs and toes floated in the
air: nyayo juu, the spectators shouted,
and sang playfully.</p>

<p><em>Nyayo Nyayo juu
<br>Hakuna matata
<br>Fuata Nyayo
<br>Hakuna matata
<br>Turukeni angani</em></p>
<p>But their attention was fixed on the
hands and arms. Organs that only a
few minutes before were displaying an
incredible array of skills, could hardly
move a yard. A few steps, the hands
cried out in pain, the arms staggered,
wobbled, and let the body fall. They
rested and then made another attempt.
This time they tried to spread out the
fingers the better to hold the ground
but only the thumbs were able to
stretch. They tried cartwheels but this
move was disqualified because for its
completion it involved the legs as well.
It was the turn of the toes to laugh.
They borrowed thick throatal tones
from the mouth to contrast their laugh
from the squeaky tones the fingers
had used. Hearing the scorn, the arms
were very angry and they made one
desperate attempt to carry the body.
They did not manage a step. Exhausted
the hands and fingers gave up. The
legs were happy to display their
athletic prowess: they marked time,
trotted, ran, made a few high jumps,
long jumps, without once letting the
body fall. All the feet of the spectators
stamped the ground in approval and
solidarity. Arms raised their hands to
protest this unsportslimbship,
conveniently forgetting that they had
started the game.</p>
<p>But all of them, including the
spectators, noted something strange
about the arms: the thumbs which had
stretched out when the hands were
trying to carry the body, remained
separated from the other fingers. The
rival organs were about to resume
their laughter when they noted
something else; far from the separated
thumb making the hands less efficient,
it enhanced their crasping and
grasping power. What's this?
Deformity transformed into the power
of forming!</p>
<p>The debate among the organs to decide
the winner went on for five days, the
number of fingers and toes on each
limb. But try as they could they were
not able declare a clear winner; each
set of limbs was best at what they did
best; none could do without the other.
There begun a session of philosophical
speculation: what was the body
anyway, they all asked, and they
realized the body was them all
together; they were into each other.
Every organ had to function well for
all to function well.</p>
<p>But to prevent such a contest in the
future and to prevent their getting in
each others way, it was decided by all
the organs, that thenceforth the body
would walk upright, feet firmly on the
ground and arms up in the air. The
body was happy with the decision but
it would allow children to walk on all
fours so as not to forget their origins.
They divided tasks: the legs would
carry the body but once they got to the
destination, hands would do all the
work that needed making or holding
tools. While the legs and feet did the
heavy duty of carrying, the hands
reached out and used their skills to
work the environment, and ensure
that food reached the mouth. Mouth,
or rather, its teeth, would chew it, and
send it down the throat to the tummy.
Tummy would squeeze all the
goodness and then pour it into its
system of canals through which the
goodness would be distributed to all
the nooks and crooks of the body.
Then tummy would take the used
material into its sewage system, from
where the body would deposit it in the
open fields or bury it under the soil to
enrich it. Plants would grow bear fruit;
hands would pluck pick some of it and
put in the mouth. Oh, yes, the circle of
life.</p>
<p>Even games and entertainments were
divided accordingly: singing, laughing
and talking were left to the mouth;
running and soccer largely left to the
legs; while baseball and basketball
were reserved for the hands, except
that the legs were to do the running. In
athletics, the legs had all the field to
themselves, largely. The clear division
of labor made the human body a
formidable bio machine, outwitting
even the largest of animals in what it
could achieve in quantity and quality.
However the organs of the body
realized that the permanent
arrangement they had arrived at could
still bring conflict. The head being up
there might make it feel that it was
better than the feet that touched the
ground or that it was the master and
the organs below it, servants only.
They stressed that in terms of power,
the head and whatever was below it,
were equal. To underline this, the
organs made sure that pain and joy of
any one of the organs was felt by all.
They warned the mouth that when
saying my this and that, it was talking
as the whole body and not as the sole
owner.</p>
<p>They sang:</p>

<p><em>In our body
<br>There's no servant
<br>In our body
<br>There's no servant
<br>We serve one another
<br>Us for Us
<br>We serve one another
<br>Us for Us
<br>We serve one another
<br>The tongue our voice
<br>Hold me and I hold you
<br>We build healthy body
<br>Hold me and I hold you
<br>We build healthy body
<br>Beauty is unity
<br>Together we work
<br>For a healthy body
<br>Together we work
<br>For a healthy body
<br>Unity is our power</em></p>
<p>This became the All Body Anthem. The
body sings is to this day and this is
what tells the difference between
humans and animals, or those that
rejected the upright revolution.
Despite what they saw, the four-legged
animals would have none of this
revolution. The singing business was
ridiculous. The mouth was made to eat
and not to sing. They formed nature's
conservative party and stuck to their
ways never changing their habits.
When humans learn from the net-
work of organs, they do well; but
when they see the body and the head
as parties at war, one being atop of the
other, they come close to their animal
cousins who rejected the upright
revolution.</p>
