<h1 >WHY THE CHEETAH'S CHEEKS ARE STAINED</h1>
<P><em>"Kwasuka sukela...."</em></P>


<P>Long ago a wicked and lazy hunter
was sitting under a tree. He was
thinking that it was too hot to be
bothered with the arduous task of
stalking prey through the bushes.
Below him in the clearing on the
grassy veld there were fat springbok
grazing. But this hunter couldn't be
bothered, so lazy was he! He gazed
at the herd, wishing that he could
have the meat without the work, when
suddenly he noticed a movement off
to the left of the buck. It was a
female cheetah seeking food.</P>
<P>Keeping downwind of the herd, she
moved closer and closer to them.
She singled out a springbok who had
foolishly wandered away from the
rest. Suddenly she gathered her long
legs under her and sprang forward.
With great speed she came upon the
springbok and brought it down.</P>
<P>Startled, the rest of the herd raced
away as the cheetah quickly killed
her prey.<BR>
The hunter watched as the cheetah
dragged her prize to some shade on
the edge of the clearing. There three
beautiful cheetah cubs were waiting
there for her. The lazy hunter was
filled with envy for the cubs and
wished that he could have such a
good hunter provide for him. Imagine
dining on delicious meat every day
without having to do the actual
hunting! Then he had a wicked idea.
He decided that he would steal one
of the cheetah cubs and train it to
hunt for him. He decided to wait until
the mother cheetah went to the
waterhole late in the afternoon to
make his move. He smiled to
    himself.</BR></P>
<P>When the sun began to set, the
cheetah left her cubs concealed in a
bush and set off to the waterhole.
Quickly the hunter grabbed his spear
and trotted down to the bushes
where the cubs were hidden. There
he found the three cubs, still to
young to be frightened of him or to
run away. He first chose one, then
decided upon another, and then
changed his mind again. Finally he
stole them all, thinking to himself
that three cheetahs would
undoubtedly be better than one.</P>
<P>When their mother returned half-an-
hour later and found her babies
gone, she was broken-hearted. The
poor mother cheetah cried and cried
until her tears made dark stains
down her cheeks. She wept all night
and into the next day. She cried so
loudly that she was heard by an old
man who came to see what the noise
was all about.<BR>
Now this old man was wise and knew
the ways of the animals. When he
discovered what the wicked hunter
had done, he became very angry. The
lazy hunter was not only a thief, he
had broken the traditions of the tribe.
Everyone knew that a hunter must
use only his own strength and skill.<BR>
Any other way of hunting was surely
    a dishonour.</BR>
<P>The old man returned to the village
and told the elders what has
happened. The villagers became
angry. They found the lazy hunter
and drove him away from the village.
The old man took the three cheetah
cubs back to their grateful mother.
But the long weeping of the mother
cheetah stained her face forever.</P>
<P>Today the cheetah wears the
tearstains on its face as a reminder
to the hunters that it is not
honourable to hunt in any other way
than that which is traditional.</P>
